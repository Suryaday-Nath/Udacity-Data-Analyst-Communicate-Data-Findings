# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Communicate-Data-Findings
Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 5

### Project Details

1. Dataset: [Ford GoBike](https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data)
2. Explore the data: Feel free to explore the jupyter notebook where the dataset is visually, and programatically explored. 
3. Document the story: organized findings convey a story to present to an audience.
4. Communicate the findings - a slide deck with my findings is prepared for a curious audience.

### Project Findings
This project is a win - win situation where a large number of people can benefit from this program:

- Environmentally friendly, budget friendly, and lifetsyle friendly.
- Subscribers (i.e. daily commuters) benefit from a health commuting choice.
- Customers (i.e. tourists, students, etc.) have a sustainable, yet flexible option for touring the city.
- Affordable and convenient transportation for the people of all socioeconomic classes.
- Renting a bike from theFord GoBike System is a fantastic (healthy and environmentally friendly) way of moving around in the city, both for enjoyment and work. 

There are two types of clients using the system: Subscribers and Customers. Subscribers are primarily daily commuters, having short trips to and from work, who rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9am and 5-6pm. Customers are usually tourists or occassional riders who use the system mainly on weekends to explore the Bay Area. Age is also a factor within user type. Subscribers who fall in the age group between 26-35 years old are the most common age group to use the bike sharing system. The 26-35 years old also lead the spike which occurs across all age groups in October. Subscribers who fall in the 36-45 year old age group are the next most common age group to use the bike sharing system, and follow a similar trend at the 26-35 year olds.
